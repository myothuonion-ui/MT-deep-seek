## [2.3.3] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **OSINT stage skipped for domain targets.** A session always started at
  `reconnaissance` and (with `_advance_stage` never regressing) could never enter
  the `osint` stage — so a real domain target (e.g. `drhmonegyi.cc`) skipped
  subdomain enumeration, crt.sh, Google dorking, theHarvester, etc. Now a public
  domain/host target **starts in the OSINT stage** and is held there after the
  initial scan, with an injected OSINT checklist (subfinder/amass, crt.sh, DNS +
  zone transfer, dorks, theHarvester, whatweb/wafw00f, wayback) guiding the AI
  before deeper scanning. A bare **private IP still skips OSINT** (correct — no
  internet OSINT on a lab host). `_should_run_osint()` decides; unit-tested.

## [2.3.2] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **Terminal flooded with polling logs** — the Streamlit auto-refresh polls a
  handful of read-only endpoints every few seconds, and (a) `GET /api/sessions/{id}`
  logged three debug INFO lines per poll, plus (b) uvicorn logged every
  `GET ... 200 OK`. Together they buried real events. Removed the debug logs and
  added a `uvicorn.access` filter that drops successful GET polls of the noisy
  read endpoints (keeps POST/DELETE, non-2xx, and app logs). The terminal is now
  quiet enough to see actual scan/AI/error events.
- **Session names with spaces/special chars** (e.g. "Dr HG") produced a session_id
  with a space (`Dr HG_...`), awkward in URLs/paths. Names are now slugified
  (`Dr-HG_...`).

## [2.3.1] — 2026-08-13

### Changed
- **Coverage Engine and Brute-force worker now default ON**, and are toggleable
  live from the UI — **Settings → 🚀 Engine Features** (Coverage Engine, Brute-force,
  Full-Auto mode). Changes apply immediately (mutate the live flag) **and** persist
  to `.env` (`POST /api/settings/features`), so end users never edit files. Field
  note that prompted this: a v2.3.0 lab run still stopped early / didn't lift
  coverage because the flags were left OFF in `.env`; defaulting ON + a Settings
  toggle removes that footgun. New API: `GET/POST /api/settings/features`,
  `orchestrator.get_feature_flags()/set_feature_flag()`. Unit-tested.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-08-13 — Coverage Engine

The shift from opportunistic LLM-guessing to **methodology-driven coverage**
(design: `docs/coverage-engine-design.md`, plan: `docs/coverage-engine-buildplan.md`).
Target-agnostic — everything keys on service type, not a specific lab. All new
capability is additive and, where it changes loop behaviour, gated behind flags
(`COVERAGE_ENGINE`, `BRUTEFORCE_ENABLED`), both default OFF.

### Added
- **M0 — Benchmark harness.** `benchmarks/score.py` scores an engagement report
  against a lab's ground-truth vulnerability set (`benchmarks/labs/kmn_training_win.json`,
  35 items) — turning "did it improve?" into a number (touched % + confirmed %,
  per-category, missed list). Dependency-free; unit-tested (`tests/test_benchmark.py`).
  **Baseline (v2.2.7 run):** touched 16/35 (45.7%), confirmed 1/35 (2.9%); web_cms
  and windows_system at 0 — recorded in `benchmarks/README.md`.
- **M1 (part 1) — Playbook registry** (`core/playbooks.py`). Declarative per-service
  methodology: `PlaybookStep` schema (deterministic vs AI steps), playbooks for
  http/tomcat/glassfish/jenkins/smb/ftp/ssh/mysql/winrm/rdp/generic, service→playbook
  classification, and command rendering. Pure data (no orchestrator coupling yet) —
  unit-tested (`tests/test_playbooks.py`). Not yet wired into the live loop; that
  integration lands behind a `COVERAGE_ENGINE` flag next.
- **M1 (part 2) — Coverage model** (`core/coverage.py`). Per-service step tracking
  (pending/done/skipped), monotonic service state
  (untested→enumerated→tested→exploited→post_ex), coverage ratio, and a
  **coverage-derived objective progress** formula plus an `is_objective_complete()`
  guard that blocks premature completion (requires a foothold **and** ≥85% service
  coverage **and** ≥85% progress). Targets a field bug: a run marked "OBJECTIVE
  COMPLETE 100%" on a single MySQL foothold while ~30 vulns were untouched.
  Unit-tested (`tests/test_coverage.py`).
  **Benchmark check (2026-08-13 completed run, pre-engine):** touched 17/35
  (48.6%), confirmed 1/35 (2.9%) — barely above baseline; the number the engine
  must beat.
- **M2 — Vulnerability validation** (`core/vuln_validate.py`, always on). Version-aware
  filtering + `confidence` + `potential`/`confirmed` status. Suppresses TLS-only CVEs
  on plain services (Heartbleed-on-FileZilla) and downgrades version-major-mismatch
  keyword hits (Tomcat 3.x CVE on a 8.5 target). NSE/exploit sources = confirmed;
  NVD/searchsploit = potential until validated. Unit-tested.
- **M3 — Exploit mapping** (`core/exploit_map.py`). Curated, target-agnostic
  knowledge base mapping service/tech → concrete exploit candidates (Ghostcat,
  WAR deploy, INTO OUTFILE/UDF, EternalBlue, BlueKeep, vsftpd backdoor, WP plugin
  RCE, WebDAV…). Surfaced to the AI as a "KNOWN EXPLOIT CANDIDATES" prompt block
  so it attempts known paths (COVERAGE_ENGINE-gated).
- **M4 — Post-exploitation + Windows RCE capture.** `_is_windows_rce_proof()` +
  `windows-rce` signal capture a web-shell/exec SYSTEM foothold that the
  Unix/msf-centric signals missed (guarded against enumeration output that merely
  lists the SYSTEM SID). New `POSTEX_STEPS` checklist (identity, host, users,
  AV/firewall/UAC, network/LLMNR/IPv6, cred harvest, privesc, loot) activates on a
  foothold and is injected as a POST-EXPLOITATION block — this is what surfaces the
  host/system-level findings. Post-ex coverage feeds the progress formula.
- **M5 — Brute-force worker** (`core/bruteforce_worker.py`, `BRUTEFORCE_ENABLED`).
  Decoupled credential **producer**: submits discovered auth services (ssh/ftp/
  rdp/mysql/smb/winrm), brute-forces in the background with tiered wordlists
  (built-in defaults → rockyou top-N → full), and pushes hits to the credential
  store (`_ingest_credential`) which the main loop reuses — never blocking the
  tactical loop. Bounded (per-service timeout, concurrency), scope-gated, safe when
  tools are missing. Injectable runner → unit-tested without hydra.
  API: `GET /api/sessions/{id}/bruteforce`.
- **M6 — Coverage & brute-force UI.** Overview shows a **methodology coverage
  matrix** (per-service % + state + pending steps, plus post-ex) and a
  **brute-force panel** (per-service job status + creds found). Objective progress
  is now coverage-derived.

New env: `COVERAGE_ENGINE`, `BRUTEFORCE_ENABLED`, `BRUTEFORCE_TIER`,
`BRUTEFORCE_MAX_SECONDS_PER_SERVICE`, `BRUTEFORCE_CONCURRENCY`. Suite: 125 passed.
- **M1 (part 3) — Live wiring behind `COVERAGE_ENGINE` flag** (default OFF, so
  existing behaviour is unchanged). When enabled, the orchestrator: seeds
  per-service playbook coverage after the scan (`_ensure_coverage`); injects a
  **METHODOLOGY COVERAGE** block into the AI prompt listing each service's pending
  steps ("work every step; do not skip a service"); marks steps done from executed
  commands (`match_and_mark`, tool/signal based); and **derives objective progress
  + completion from coverage** (`_recompute_coverage_progress`), overriding the
  strategist's estimate so a run can't hit 100% while services are untouched.
  Target-agnostic — playbooks key on service type, not a specific lab.
  `service_coverage` (per-service % + state + pending intents) exposed in the
  session report. New env: `COVERAGE_ENGINE`. Suite: 113 passed.

## [2.2.7] — 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **Session silently went idle at `ready` and never recovered** (log showed ~9 minutes of pure UI polling — no AI calls, no commands — while the header still said "Session Active"). The stuck-session watchdog only revived `analyzing`/`executing` sessions and deliberately left `ready` alone, so a FULL_AUTO session that stopped at `ready` (e.g. after an auto-pivot or a soft loop) was never restarted. The watchdog now also revives an idle `ready` session — quickly (`WATCHDOG_STALL_IDLE_SECONDS`, default 120s) — **unless** it has a command awaiting manual approval (a legitimate wait, left untouched). `analyzing`/`executing` keep the long stall so genuinely-running work isn't interrupted. New env var: `WATCHDOG_STALL_IDLE_SECONDS`.

## [2.2.6] — 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **Session view froze on "Scanning" while the AI was actually running.** The `pref_auto_refresh` setting was saved but never actually used — nothing re-ran the page — so the Overview showed whatever snapshot was first loaded and never reflected backend progress (hosts/services/commands/decisions/stage). The AI loop was working fine in the backend the whole time; only the UI was stale. Live auto-refresh is now implemented: while a session is active (scanning/analyzing/executing/ready) the page re-runs every `Refresh interval` seconds (default 5). Added a manual **🔄 Refresh** button + a `🟢 live`/`⏸ manual` indicator. Turn auto-refresh off in **Settings** for uninterrupted chatting.

## [2.2.5] — 2026-08-13

### Changed
- **Single source of truth for the version.** The version now lives only in `_version.py`; the frontend sidebar/About and the FastAPI backend (`/`, OpenAPI) import it at runtime, so they can no longer drift out of sync (previously the sidebar showed a stale `2.1.1` while the API said `2.0.0`). To release, edit `_version.py` or run `python bump_version.py X.Y.Z` — which also updates the README badge in one step. Only the changelog entry stays manual.

## [2.2.4] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Persistent chat transcript (messenger-style).** The AI chat now keeps a full per-session conversation instead of overwriting a single answer. Messages are stored in a new `chat_messages` table, reloaded on restart, and rendered as scrollable right/left bubbles so you can review the whole conversation. Exposed via `session.chat_history` in the session report.
- **Enter-to-send.** Both the chat and steer inputs are now `st.form`s, so pressing **Enter** submits (no longer requires clicking the button).

### Changed
- **Steering is now limited to active sessions.** The 🎯 Steer input only appears while a session is actually running (scanning/analyzing/executing/ready); for inactive sessions the chat shows a note instead. Keeps the chat clean and instructions scoped to the live engagement.

### Fixed
- **After `./start.sh` restart, sessions showed `ready` but the AI wasn't actually running** (no Resume, no activity in the log). Restored sessions with status `ready` weren't queued for auto-resume (only scanning/analyzing/executing were), so `ready` looked active but nothing ran. `ready` is now included in auto-resume, so a restored session genuinely continues.

## [2.2.3] — 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **"Agentic loop error" on every turn — `UnboundLocalError: _queued_already`.** In `_process_command_output`, `_queued_already` was only assigned in the non-FULL_AUTO branch, but the trailing `elif not _queued_already` ran in all modes — so under `FULL_AUTO_MODE` (and on the critique-reject path) it raised `UnboundLocalError`, which the handler turned into a `loop_error` and paused the session. Now initialised before the branch and set on the FULL_AUTO critique-reject path. Regression-tested.
- **Resume button did nothing when a session was paused.** A recovery/pause state (`loop_error`, `no_next_step`, `watchdog_stalled`, `pivot_limit_reached`, `loop_prevention`) leaves `status="ready"`, which both the frontend and the `/resume` endpoint treated as "already running" — so Resume was greyed out and the endpoint no-op'd. Both now detect the paused context from the last decision and make Resume clickable and functional.
- **`name 'shlex' is not defined` during command execution.** `_inject_credentials` used `shlex.quote` but `shlex` was only imported locally in another method. Added the top-level import.

## [2.2.2] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Markdown report (zero-dependency)** — new `📝 Download Markdown Report` button + `GET /api/sessions/{id}/report/md`. Pure Python, no `python-docx`/`fpdf2` needed, so it always works. Renders the FULL engagement in order: metadata, executive summary, services, vulnerability findings (+ details), credentials, **confirmed compromises with proof snippets**, attack plan + operator steering + exhausted vectors, the **complete executed-command log (chronological, with output)**, and **every attack decision/idea (chronological, with pivot/operator/shell tags)**. Regression-tested (`tests/test_report.py`).

### Fixed
- **DOCX/PDF reports were incomplete or broken.** DOCX truncated the AI decision log to the last 10 and omitted confirmed compromises, the attack plan, and operator steering. The PDF read the wrong session keys (`commands`/`services` instead of `commands_executed`/`discovered_services`) — producing empty command/service sections — and crashed on `cve_ids` (already a list, not JSON). All now render every finding, command, and decision in order; DOCX adds Confirmed Compromises + Attack Plan & Operator Steering sections and the full chronological decision log.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-08-12

### Changed
- **Steer & Ask is now a floating chat bubble** (Facebook-style) pinned bottom-right, open from **any** tab of a session — not just the Overview. Click **💬 AI Chat** to pop open the Steer + Ask box; the bubble shows a badge with the count of active operator instructions. Implemented with `st.popover` + fixed-position CSS; on older Streamlit (< 1.31, no `st.popover`) it gracefully falls back to the inline panel on the Overview tab.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Live operator steering** — send the running AI a free-text instruction mid-engagement ("Focus on GlassFish 4848", "skip SMB", "try Ghostcat on 8009"). It's injected as a **HIGHEST-PRIORITY** block into every subsequent AI decision, so you can redirect the autonomous loop without stopping it. Applies on the AI's next decision (doesn't interrupt a running command). Persists across restarts (rebuilt from the logged `operator_instruction` decisions). Endpoint: `POST /api/sessions/{id}/steer`.
- **Status chat** — ask the AI about the current engagement ("What have you found?", "What's blocking you?", "What next?") and get a concise, state-grounded answer. Read-only: it runs a one-off summary call over live session state and never executes anything or touches the loop. Endpoint: `POST /api/sessions/{id}/ask`.
- **Frontend "🧭 Steer & Ask" panel** on the session Overview: a Steer input + an Ask input with the AI's answer inline, plus a line showing the active operator instructions. New AI-Decision badge `🧭 steer`.

## [2.1.9] — 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **NVD CVE lookups hammered the API and got HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests).** NVD's public limit is 5 requests / 30 s without a key (≈6 s apart), but the caller waited only 0.7 s — so after ~10 services every lookup 429'd and returned nothing. Rate limiting now lives inside `cve_lookup.lookup_cves_nvd()` behind a module-level lock (`NVD_MIN_INTERVAL`, default 6.5 s; 0.6 s when `NVD_API_KEY` is set) with exponential backoff + retry on 429. The redundant caller-side sleep was removed.
- **NVD keyword queries returned 0 hits from noisy banners.** Nmap version strings like `Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Win64) OpenSSL/1.0.2q PHP/5.6.40)` were sent verbatim and matched nothing. `_clean_nvd_query()` now trims everything from the first `(` so NVD sees `Apache httpd 2.4.38`.
- **Wasted NVD requests on generic services.** `msrpc`, `netbios-ssn`, `microsoft-ds`, `ms-wbt-server`, etc. never yield keyword CVEs; they're now skipped, cutting request volume (and 429 pressure) substantially.
- **`_parse_response()` (Vulners) returned `None`.** The function built its `results` list but never returned it, so `lookup_cves()` yielded `None` instead of a list. Added the missing `return` (regression-tested).

### Note
- The `429`/`0 CVE` lines in earlier logs are the symptom above — the free NVD path now paces itself correctly. For faster/looser limits, set `NVD_API_KEY` in `.env` (free from nvd.nist.gov).

## [2.1.8] — 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **Every session failed at ~5 commands: `'Orchestrator' object has no attribute '_EPISODE_SIZE'`.** `_create_episode_summary()` referenced `self._EPISODE_SIZE`, but `_EPISODE_SIZE` is a **Session** attribute — so once a session reached the episode-summary interval (5 commands), `execute_command` raised `AttributeError`, was caught by its outer handler, and the session was marked `failed` (the loop stopped and the UI stopped updating). Now reads `session._EPISODE_SIZE`. Regression test added.
- **`GET /api/vulnerabilities` → 500 (`no such column: s.target_hostname`).** The global vulnerabilities query joined non-existent columns `s.target_hostname` and `s.name`. The `sessions` table has `target_ip` + `target_domain` (and `session_id` doubles as the name). Query corrected — the Threat Intel structured-vuln table and dashboard vuln widget load again.

## [2.1.7] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Session History management** — the History page now lets you clean up recorded sessions (previously they could only accumulate):
  - Per-session **🗑️ Delete** button on every card (failed/completed included), with an inline confirm.
  - **🗑️ Clear ALL History** (two-step confirm) and **🧹 Clear Failed (N)** bulk actions.

### Fixed
- **Session delete left orphaned shell rows** — `delete_session` / `delete_all_sessions` now also clear the `shell_handlers` and `shell_sessions_log` tables and stop any live `ShellManager` for the deleted session(s).

## [2.1.6] — 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **Session stuck at "scanning" long past the timeout (scan never returned).** Scans launch via `create_subprocess_shell`, so the process handle is the `/bin/sh` wrapper and nmap is its child. On timeout the old code called `process.kill()` (kills only the shell) then `await process.communicate()` — which **blocked until nmap finished on its own** because the still-running child held the stdout pipe open. Effect: the 5-minute `SCAN_TIMEOUT` never actually fired; on a host with many slow services (RMI/JMX/GIOP/GlassFish) the session sat in `scanning` for as long as nmap ran (10+ minutes). Fixes:
  - New `_run_shell_bounded()` / `_kill_process_group()` helpers launch scans with `start_new_session=True` and, on timeout, `killpg` the **whole process group** (child included), then collect output with a bounded 5s wait.
  - `perform_nmap_scan`, `perform_vulnerability_scan`, and `perform_vulnerability_scan_port` all use the bounded runner and now **parse partial output** on timeout instead of discarding it.
  - nmap profiles gained `--host-timeout` (SCAN_TIMEOUT − 60s) + `--max-retries 2` so nmap self-bounds and returns graceful partial results before the hard kill.
  - Initial recon (`default` profile) dropped `-sC` default scripts — the slowest phase on service-heavy hosts; targeted script/vuln scans still run in the background NSE pass and via AI-proposed commands.
  - `orchestrator.execute_command` had the same shell-wrapper bug (a hung tool orphaned the real process); it now launches with `start_new_session=True` and `killpg`s the group on timeout.

## [2.1.5] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Autonomous shell capture — AI catches its own sessions in the Shells tab.** Previously an exploit the AI fired opened its session inside a throwaway `msfconsole` process the manager never monitored, so it never appeared in the UI. Now the loop wires exploitation to the managed handler end-to-end:
  - **Auto-started listener** — when the engagement reaches an exploitation stage (`exploitation`/`post_exploitation`/`privilege_escalation`/`lateral_movement`/`credential_reuse`), `_ensure_exploitation_handler()` spins up one managed `multi/handler` (idempotent per session). LHOST defaults to the local IP (`EXPLOIT_LHOST` override), LPORT to `4444` (`EXPLOIT_LPORT`), payload auto-guessed from the target OS (`_guess_default_payload()`; `EXPLOIT_PAYLOAD` override).
  - **AI payload directive** — `_handler_context_block()` injects the live LHOST/LPORT/payload into every AI prompt with hard rules: deliver reverse shells to this listener, use these values in msfvenom / MSF modules, and never start your own handler.
  - **Session-opened callback** — `MsfHandlerProcess` now fires `on_session_opened`; the orchestrator persists each caught session to `shell_sessions_log` and logs a visible `shell_caught` decision. Caught sessions surface in the **🐚 Shells** tab automatically (no polling).
  - **Frontend** — Overview shows a green "Live shell caught!" banner (and a "Listener up" info banner when the handler starts); new AI-Decision badges `🎧 listener`, `🐚 shell!`.
  - New env vars: `EXPLOIT_LHOST`, `EXPLOIT_LPORT`, `EXPLOIT_PAYLOAD`.

## [2.1.4] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Stuck-session watchdog** (`watchdog_loop` / `_watchdog_tick`) — background task (started at API startup) that detects sessions wedged in an active status (`analyzing`/`executing`) with no progress for `WATCHDOG_STALL_SECONDS` (default `COMMAND_TIMEOUT + 180`). It nudges them back into motion up to `WATCHDOG_MAX_NUDGES` (default 2), then logs a visible `watchdog_stalled` decision and returns to `ready`. `_touch_activity()` records progress at command start/finish and on every AI decision. Env-tunable: `WATCHDOG_INTERVAL`, `WATCHDOG_STALL_SECONDS`, `WATCHDOG_MAX_NUDGES`.
- **Exploitation evidence capture** — when a command's output proves code execution/shell access, `_capture_exploitation_evidence()` records the service, host, port, command, **privilege level** (`_detect_privilege_level()` → root/SYSTEM, administrator, or user), matched signal, and a proof snippet. Persisted to the evidence table and deduped per (service, privilege).
- **AI post-exploitation awareness** — confirmed compromises are injected into the AI context (`_compromise_context_block`) with an instruction to move to privilege-escalation/pivoting instead of re-running an exploit that already worked (a common enumeration-loop cause). Exhausted-vector context is now also shared with the tactical loop (`_exhausted_context_block`).
- **Frontend — confirmed compromises panel** on the Overview tab: green success banner with per-compromise expanders (privilege icon, command, proof snippet). New AI-Decision badges: `🐕 watchdog`.
- **Regression suite** `tests/test_agentic_loop.py` — 17 tests covering empty/no-response recovery, auto-pivot + limit, watchdog nudge/flag/rest, strategist triggers, and exploitation evidence capture + dedup.

### Fixed
- **Agentic loop silently stalled at `ready` (reason-and-continue never progressed)** — the root cause was the LLM occasionally returning valid JSON with an **empty `suggested_command`**. Both `_analyze_with_ai()` and `_process_command_output()` handled this by doing nothing, leaving the session at `status=ready` with no pending command and no error — indistinguishable from "frozen." Now:
  - Empty commands route to `_handle_empty_command()`, which retries the analysis up to `MAX_EMPTY_RETRIES` (default 3) with a hard "you MUST return a concrete command" directive, then logs a visible `no_next_step` decision and returns to `ready`.
  - `_process_command_output()`'s previously-silent `except Exception` now records a visible `loop_error` decision instead of dying quietly.
  - Frontend surfaces both new states with banners and AI-Decision badges (`🤔 no-step`, `⚠️ error`).
- **`None` AI response was a non-resumable dead-end** — a model timeout / JSON-parse failure set `status=error` and stopped. Both sites now route through the same retry+visible-halt recovery, so a transient hiccup self-heals.
- **Strategist never ran → objective progress frozen** — the strategist only fired every `PLANNER_INTERVAL` (5) completed commands, so sessions that stalled before command #5 never advanced progress. It now also runs on the first command (bootstrap, when no plan exists) and whenever the engagement advances a stage.
- **Unit tests broke on DB writes** — `make_orch` now stubs `_save_ai_decision` / `_save_session_status`, fixing `credential_reuse` and `strategist` tests that failed once AI-decision DB persistence was added.

## [2.1.3] — 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Auto-pivot on loop detection** (`core/orchestrator.py`) — when the anti-loop guardrail fires, the session no longer halts. Instead it automatically:
  1. Detects which attack vector was being looped on (`_detect_exhausted_target()` heuristic).
  2. Adds it to `session.exhausted_services` (persisted to DB, survives restarts).
  3. Logs an `auto_pivot` decision in the AI Decisions tab.
  4. Resets the auto-execution depth counter and re-invokes the AI with the exhausted vector injected as context — so the AI skips it and picks the next viable target.
- **`_detect_exhausted_target()`** — module-level heuristic that classifies recent commands into a named vector label (`smb`, `ftp`, `tomcat_8080`, `glassfish`, `ssh_bruteforce`, `web_dir_enum`, etc.).
- **`_auto_pivot()` method** — orchestrator method driving the pivot flow. Enforces a configurable `MAX_AUTO_PIVOTS` cap (default 6, via env var). When the cap is hit, logs a `pivot_limit_reached` decision and falls back to manual-wait.
- **`EXHAUSTED ATTACK VECTORS` block in AI context** — injected at the top of every `_analyze_with_ai()` call when `session.exhausted_services` is non-empty. AI receives a hard instruction not to suggest any command targeting an exhausted vector.
- **`exhausted_services` DB column** — added to `sessions` table via migration. Saved on every status transition. Restored on backend restart.
- **Frontend — exhausted services display** (Overview tab):
  - Auto-pivot in progress → `🔄 Auto-pivoting` info banner listing which vectors were exhausted.
  - Pivot limit reached → `🛑 Auto-pivot limit reached` error banner.
  - Always-visible caption listing all exhausted vectors when non-empty.
- **AI Decisions log badges** — context-specific badges on each decision row: `🔁 loop`, `🔄 pivot`, `🛑 pivot-limit`, `🛡 vetoed`.
- **`MAX_AUTO_PIVOTS` env var** — operator-configurable cap on consecutive auto-pivots before falling back to manual. Default `6`.

---

## [2.1.2] — 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Shell Session Manager** (`core/shell_manager.py`) — new module managing persistent Metasploit `multi/handler` processes.
  - `MsfHandlerProcess`: long-running `msfconsole` subprocess with `stdin=PIPE` for command injection and stdout monitoring for session-opened events.
  - `ShellSession`: tracks one active meterpreter/shell session with full command history (last 100 commands).
  - `ShellManager`: per-pentest-session container for all handlers.
  - Echo-marker output capture with `CMD_OUTPUT_TIMEOUT` (20 s).
  - `get_local_ip()` helper auto-detects LHOST suggestion.
  - `COMMON_PAYLOADS` list covers Windows/Linux x86/x64 meterpreter and shell payloads.

- **Shell API endpoints** (main.py):
  - `POST /api/sessions/{id}/shells/handler` — start listener
  - `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}/shells/handler/{handler_id}` — stop listener
  - `GET /api/sessions/{id}/shells/handlers` — list live + DB-persisted handlers
  - `GET /api/sessions/{id}/shells` — list active shell sessions
  - `POST /api/sessions/{id}/shells/{handler_id}/{msf_id}/exec` — run command in session
  - `GET /api/sessions/{id}/shells/{handler_id}/{msf_id}/history` — command history
  - `GET /api/shells/local-ip` — LHOST suggestion

- **🐚 Shells tab** (Active Sessions, tab 8):
  - Listener management: LHOST/LPORT/payload form with auto-detected LHOST and live msfvenom command preview.
  - Active session panel: quick-action buttons (whoami, sysinfo, ipconfig, ps), free-form command input, output display, command history.
  - Usage guide with meterpreter command reference.
  - Session count badge on tab label.

- **AI shell awareness** — active shell sessions injected into `_analyze_with_ai()` context so the AI uses existing shells for post-exploitation instead of re-exploiting.

- **DB tables**: `shell_handlers` (persists LHOST/LPORT/payload for restart), `shell_sessions_log` (session history).

- **Threat Intel page — Structured Vulnerability Database section** — pulls from `vulnerabilities` table across all sessions. Filterable by source (NVD, searchsploit, nmap-vuln-script, Vulners), risk level, and service substring. Source trust badges, CVSS scores, NVD/ExploitDB deep-links.

- **Global `/api/vulnerabilities` endpoint** — cross-session vulnerability query with optional filters.

- **Action-required banners on Overview tab** — orange banner with inline ✅/❌ approve/deny buttons for pending commands; yellow warning for loop-prevention decisions.

### Fixed
- **Anti-loop guardrail bypassed by flag/suffix variations** — previous exact-match check was evaded by appending `2>&1 | tee /tmp/...` or changing `-R` to `-r`. New `_norm_cmd()` strips output-redirection suffixes and normalises before comparison. Window expanded from last-5 to last-8 commands.
- **Stage stagnation not detected** — added second check: if 8+ consecutive AI decisions share the same `attack_phase` without advancing, auto-execution halts with a `loop_prevention` decision.
- **Reset AI left vulnerability analysis incomplete** — `restart_session` cleared `session.vulnerabilities` in memory but did not: (a) delete DB rows, (b) clear NSE/NVD/searchsploit completion markers, or (c) re-trigger `_run_vulnerability_analysis()`. All three now happen on Reset AI.
- **Vulnerabilities tab always empty after Reset AI** — consequence of the above; fixed by the same changes.
- **Vulnerabilities tab empty message mentioned Vulners only** — updated to accurately describe the free sources (Nmap NSE, NIST NVD, local searchsploit).
- **Session control buttons hidden while executing** — Reset AI, Delete, Full Rescan were inside the `else` branch of `if in_progress`, making them invisible during active execution. Now always visible; only Resume/Start are hidden while the AI loop is running (to prevent duplicate spawning).
- **README bloat** — removed Key Features, How It Works, API Reference, Project Structure from README.md. Extracted to `features.md`. Created `change_log.md`.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-08-10

### Added
- **True resume for vulnerability analysis** — per-port Nmap NSE scans and per-service CVE lookups (NVD, searchsploit, Vulners) write completion markers to `scan_results`. Resume skips already-done work.
- **NVD NIST API v2 integration** (`cve_lookup.py`) — free public CVE lookup, no API key required. Rate-limited at 0.7 s/request. Falls back silently on error.
- **searchsploit integration** — local ExploitDB query per discovered service+version. Zero network dependency.
- **Per-port Nmap NSE vuln scan** (`scanner.py`) — `--script "vuln and not intrusive" --script-timeout 20` per open port, with separate `VULN_PORT_TIMEOUT` env var.
- **stdin=DEVNULL on all subprocesses** — eliminates terminal hijacking by interactive tools (smbclient, enum4linux, etc.).
- **Credential injection** (`_inject_credentials`) — pre-execution rewrite embeds known credentials into tool flags for smbclient, enum4linux/ng, crackmapexec, rpcclient, evil-winrm, mysql, impacket tools.
- **AI context: discovered credentials** — actual `user:pass` pairs shown to AI with per-tool embedding examples.
- **Stage + status persistence** (`_save_session_status`) — `current_stage` and `status` written to DB at every transition. Sessions no longer revert to `reconnaissance` on restart.
- **Threat Intel — Structured DB section** — new top section on the Threat Intel page shows NVD, searchsploit, and Nmap NSE findings from the `vulnerabilities` table across all sessions. Filterable by source, risk level, and service.
- **Global `/api/vulnerabilities` endpoint** — queries `vulnerabilities` table across all sessions with optional filters.
- **AI decisions persistence** — all 6 `session.ai_decisions.append()` sites now also write to `ai_decisions` DB table immediately. Restored on session reload. Cleared on restart/rescan.
- **Action-required banners on Overview tab** — orange banner with inline approve/deny buttons when commands are pending; yellow warning when loop prevention was triggered.

### Fixed
- Vulnerability analysis timing out — `--script vuln` was running all NSE scripts. Changed to `"vuln and not intrusive"` with `--script-timeout 30`.
- Vulnerability scan blocking AI analysis — was `await`ed inline; changed to `asyncio.create_task()`.
- Stage regression on restart — post-nmap stage was incorrectly set to `"vulnerability_analysis"` (skipping enumeration). Fixed to `"enumeration"`.
- smbclient `Password:` prompt hanging sessions permanently — fixed by `stdin=DEVNULL` + `_inject_credentials`.
- `_CRED_PATTERNS` IndexError — john regex had only 1 capture group, expected 2.
- `ask_ai_local` missing `memory` parameter for Ollama context.
- `_compute_next_run` crash on month-end datetime arithmetic.
- `requires_approval` substring false positives — added word-boundary matching.
- `_EXPLOIT_SIGNALS` false positives — "password", "200 ok", "database" were matching normal recon output.
- Strategic state not persisted to DB — plan was lost on backend restart.
- API system prompt using wrong message role.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-xx

### Added
- Strategic layer (AI Planner) — separate Strategist AI pass updates multi-step plan and writes reflection after each command.
- Hybrid memory retrieval (FindingsIndex) — Ollama embeddings + TF-IDF lexical fallback for semantically relevant finding lookup.
- Context-aware memory for local Ollama — adapts system prompt and output budget to model's context window size.
- Episode compression — every 5 commands, recent history is compressed to a structured summary.
- Anti-loop guardrail — halts auto-execution if AI suggests a recently-executed command; logs `loop_prevention` decision.
- VERIFIER pass — independent AI critique of high-risk commands before execution in FULL_AUTO_MODE.
- Service test-state machine — `untested → in_progress → tested → exploited` tracked deterministically.
- Deterministic credential reuse — auto-queues reuse against all discovered services when credentials are extracted.
- Scheduled scans — recurring scan schedules with cron-style configuration.
- DOCX / PDF report generation.
- Threat Intel page — AI-directed open-web research cache (`threat_intel` table).
- Scope allowlist enforcement.
