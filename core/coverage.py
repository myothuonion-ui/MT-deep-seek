"""
KMN-CyberSeek Coverage Model (Coverage Engine — M1)

Tracks, per service, which playbook steps have been attempted, derives a
service state from that, and computes a *coverage-derived* objective progress.

This replaces two failure modes observed in the field:
  - services abandoned on loop-detection before their methodology is complete
    (now: a service is "covered" only when its playbook is exhausted), and
  - the strategist declaring the objective 100% complete on a single foothold
    while most of the attack surface is untouched (now: progress and completion
    are functions of measured coverage, not the model's mood).

Pure logic — no I/O, no orchestrator coupling — so it is easy to unit-test and
safe to import anywhere. Integration into the live loop lands behind the
COVERAGE_ENGINE flag.
