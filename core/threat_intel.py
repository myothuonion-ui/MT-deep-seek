"""
KMN-CyberSeek Threat Intel Research Module
AI-directed web research for vulnerability/CVE information, feeding a local
reference cache (orchestrator's `threat_intel` table) that pentest sessions can
cross-reference against later - this is the "let the local database get better
over time" feature.

DESIGN / SAFETY NOTES (read before changing):
This fetches whatever URLs a search turns up, with no domain allowlist - that
was a deliberate choice (flexibility over restriction), made after flagging the
tradeoffs. To keep the blast radius contained despite that:

  1. This is an independent, general research task - it is NOT part of any live
     pentest session's command-execution loop. Nothing in this module ever
     produces a shell command, and it never touches ai/prompts.py's
     SYSTEM_PROMPT or the per-session agentic loop in core/orchestrator.py's
     _process_command_output(). The extraction LLM call uses its own isolated
     prompt (EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT below) that cannot emit a suggested_command.
  2. Everything extracted is stored with verified=False by the caller. A scraped
     page can contain wrong or attacker-planted information (SEO poisoning,
     prompt-injection text aimed at the extraction step) - treat results as
     leads to check, not confirmed facts, until a human or a structured source
     (Vulners/NVD/CISA KEV) corroborates them. When cross-referenced into a
     session's `vulnerabilities` table (core/orchestrator.py), these findings
     keep a distinct source_tool/status so they're visibly lower-confidence.
  3. Fetches are read-only HTTP GETs via httpx, not a literal shell `curl` -
     URLs never pass through a shell, so there's no command-injection surface
     from AI- or search-chosen URLs.
  4. No robots.txt checking is implemented and there's no domain allowlist -
     don't point this at the same site repeatedly/rapidly, and don't assume
     every source it reads is trustworthy or that its ToS permits scraping.
     That's on the operator to self-limit.
